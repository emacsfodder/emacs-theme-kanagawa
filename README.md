![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Tsunami_by_hokusai_19th_century.jpg)

A theme inspired by the colors of the famous painting by Katsushika Hokusa

Original Vim theme created by rebelot see: https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim

## Install

The theme uses [Autothemer](https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer) which may need to be installed.

```lisp
M-x package-install <return> autothemer <return>
```

To install this theme, clone this repo. In Emacs (v26.1 and above) do:

```emacs-lisp
M-x load-theme <return> kanagawa-theme.el
```

If prompted, say "yes" to enable the theme.

The location of the theme will be added to your `custom-theme-load-path`, and
`custom.el` will be updated to allow the theme to load without prompting.
